AWS Team cost reporter

A Simple command line tool for AWS Cost report

This is what it is

This tool is useful when multiple teams share one account and each team has an independent budget.
In one account, by default, costs of all teams are summed and reported, so each team can not know
the usage status and cost of their team.
In order to deal with it, AWS provices cost allocation tag.

This tool uses cost allocation tags.

This script repors each team cost and usage report with CSV format, usingã€€AWS Cost Explorer API.

Because of CE API need to access AWS North Virginia Region, you have to have access to
https://ce.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
(Thus, will not work on private, non-internet accessible environment.)
